  <h2>About Nigel</h2>
  <p>After I greaduated college, I grew a great interest for the world of technology. From following the latest advances in AI technology,
    to the newest developments for Space X. The more i learned the greater my interest grew. During my leisure studies I discovered the power and
    significance of Software Development. I instantly knew it was something that I had to eventually learn and master. Although most people love
    software development for what it can brinng them, my desire is to contribute to a purpose bigger than myself and thats what excites me most.
    With the help of Thinkful I know i can accomplish all the goals I have set for my journey and I know I will cross paths with great minds along
    the way and I am always looking to learn from any and everyone.</p>
